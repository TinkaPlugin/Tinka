''Warning: For this mechanism to work, there has to be an 'original-title' field present in the backup tiddler. This is automatically added by Tinka, however earlier versions of Tinka did not add this field. If you want to restore a backup from an earlier version of Tinka, you will have to add the 'original-title' field manually and populate it with the former title of the plugin tiddler, in order for the restore function to work.''
